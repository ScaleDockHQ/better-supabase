# Changelog

## 0.2.0 (2026-09-30)

- `createMcp` takes optional per-tool authorization hooks. `authorize(ctx, tool, args)` runs after the arguments are validated and before `run`, and returns `{ allowed: true }` or `{ allowed: false, reason?, scopes? }`. A refusal is a tool error, and a refusal with `scopes` is a 403 `insufficient_scope` challenge that lists the scopes the call needs. `visible(ctx, tool)` filters `tools/list`, and a hidden tool is called like an unknown one. `defineTool` and `mcp.tool` accept an opaque `meta`, for example a PermDock permission, which both hooks receive and clients never see. New types: `ToolRef` and `ToolDecision`. The PermDock guide has a recipe that checks PermDock permissions through a structural type.
- Align with PermDock's authorization contract, so a project can use better-supabase and PermDock on the same claims. The migration guide at https://bettersupabase.com/docs/migration/0.1-to-0.2 lists every step.

  Breaking changes:

  - The active tenant claim is `tenant_id` instead of `org_id`, in the token and in `app_metadata`. The new `claims` block in `better-supabase.config.ts` (`claims: { tenant, scope, features }`) renames it for the tenant plugin, the SQL kit, storage and realtime at once. `plugins.tenant.claim` is removed.
  - SQL kit: `better_supabase.current_org_id()` is now `current_tenant_id()`. `membership_claims()` moves to the tenant module and returns PermDock's `[{ scope, id, roles }]`. Plan features move out of memberships into `feature_claims()` in the entitlements module, which fills the `features` claim (`{ [tenantId]: string[] }`).
  - `MembershipClaim` has PermDock's shape (`scope`, `id`, `roles`, and optional `within`, `via`, `expiresAt`). `hasEntitlement` and `EntitlementKey` read the `features` claim.
  - `asUser` signs ES256 tokens with the key from `better-supabase keys` (`signing_keys_path` in `supabase/config.toml`), like a hosted project. `{ alg: 'HS256' }` keeps the shared secret and only works against a local stack.
  - `SPEC_PINS.mcp` and `MCP_PROTOCOL_VERSION` are `2026-07-28`. `createMcp` serves stateless requests (`server/discover`, request `_meta`, `Mcp-Method` and `Mcp-Name` headers) and still answers `initialize` for `2025-11-25`, `2025-06-18` and `2025-03-26` clients. A 403 carries an `insufficient_scope` challenge.
  - BS405 measures the whole token against 2 KB and, when the project has a `permdock.config.ts`, `memberships` plus `attrs` against PermDock's 1 KB budget (`doctor.claimsLimit` overrides the budget, or the whole-token limit without PermDock).

  New:

  - `sb.userMetadata(schema)` parses `user_metadata` into a typed `session.profile` for display. Metadata that fails the schema leaves `profile` undefined and logs one warning with the failing paths. No authorization code reads it. `ProfileOf<B>` in `better-supabase/react` types `useSession` from `createHooks`.
  - Buckets take a PermDock policy (`{ permdock: { read, write }, scope }`) and topics a `permdock: { receive, send, scope }` option. The generated policies check PermDock permissions through its `permitted_<scope>_ids()` or `permdock_has()` helpers instead of the tenant claim.
  - `sql add tenant` stops when a `permdock.config.ts` exists, unless you pass `--force`. Doctor BS407 reports a hook that calls `membership_claims` or writes PermDock's claims next to PermDock.
  - `better-supabase/testing` exports `signLocalJwt`, `localSigningKey`, `signTestJwtWithKey` and the `SigningJwk` type.
  - A new docs page, https://bettersupabase.com/docs/auth/permdock, shows both packages in one project.
- Doctor BS405 now measures what PermDock's budget covers. With a `permdock.config.ts`, it warns when `memberships` plus `attrs` from the hook's output pass 1024 bytes (or `doctor.claimsLimit`), measured with `octet_length` as PermDock's hook measures `supabase.hook.budget`. The whole-token check at 2048 bytes is a separate warning, so a normal PermDock token of about 1.5 KB no longer trips it. Without PermDock, `doctor.claimsLimit` still limits the whole token. `memberships_truncated` is reported as before.
- Entitlements are no longer treated as a PermDock conflict, because `features` is not a PermDock claim.

  - Doctor BS407 reports a custom access token hook next to PermDock only when it calls `better_supabase.membership_claims` or writes `roles`, `user_role`, `memberships` or the configured tenant claim itself. It no longer reports `feature_claims`, and it leaves PermDock's generated hook alone.
  - `sql add entitlements` works next to a `permdock.config.ts` without `--force`. It writes `tenant` as a dependency and prints a note. Only `sql add tenant` still needs `--force`.
  - The PermDock and entitlements docs say what works today. `has_entitlement(tenant, key)` and `tenant_entitlements(tenant)` work in SQL and RLS without a claim. `hasEntitlement(session, ...)` needs the `features` claim, which PermDock's hook doesn't write yet, so read entitlements from the database on the server until PermDock adds a hook slot for it.
- The PermDock guide lists every claim PermDock's generated hook writes (`user_role`, `roles`, `memberships`, the tenant claim, `attrs`, `authz_ver` and `memberships_truncated`). The migration guide and the `sb.userMetadata()` TSDoc say that `session.profile` is for display only, and that roles, memberships, the tenant and entitlements never come from it.
- The storage and realtime docs say that the `permdock` policy mode compares ids as text, so a path or topic segment must be the id's canonical lowercase form: an uppercase uuid is denied. An integration test covers it for buckets and topics.
- The docs now name the right PermDock command for the SQL helpers. `permdock_has` and `permitted_<scope>_ids` come from `permdock rls generate`, not from `permdock supabase hook generate`. The PermDock guide gains a setup step that runs both commands, and says that the helpers live in PermDock's `rls.schema`, which must equal the `schema` option on buckets and topics.
- Document that the `permdock` policy mode for buckets and topics only fits permissions whose grants have no row conditions beyond the scope. PermDock's helpers check role and scope, so a permission with row conditions (for example `ownerId = principal.id`) would grant every object in the scope. Leave those to the policies `permdock rls generate` writes. The storage, realtime and PermDock docs pages show a wrong and a right example, and the TSDoc on the `policy` and `permdock` options says the same.
- The PermDock guide says that a non-default `claims.tenant` must also be set as PermDock's `rls.tenantClaim` and passed to `subjectFromSupabase` or `subjectFromSupabaseSession` as `{ tenant }`, so both packages read and write the same tenant claim.
- The docs site answers questions with Ask AI, shows the last-updated date on every page, and has Open Graph images, a sitemap, type tables generated from the source, and links that add the docs MCP server to Cursor and VS Code. The repository now has a root `CHANGELOG.md`, and its fixture schema is declarative, with pgTAP tests for RLS. The published package does not change.
