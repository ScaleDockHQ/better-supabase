# APIs with better-supabase

Every adapter resolves the caller once and hands you `{ auth, db, supabase }`.
`auth.kind` is `user`, `anon`, `service` or `invalid`. For sessions, claims
and the OAuth client or agent behind a token, see the `better-supabase-auth`
skill.

## Workflow: add an endpoint

1. Pick the adapter for the runtime (table below). Setup code for each is in
   [references/adapters.md](references/adapters.md).
2. Decide who may call it with `allow`, and which scopes a delegated token
   needs with `scopes` (see below).
3. Use `db` from the handler context and return its `Result`, a plain value
   or a `Response`.
4. For a table exposed as REST, prefer `bs.resource(...)` over hand-written
   routes, and regenerate `openapi.json` with `better-supabase openapi emit`.
5. Add an API test that calls the endpoint as a user and as another tenant,
   and with a delegated token that lacks the scope (the
   `better-supabase-testing` skill).

Done when the endpoint rejects callers outside `allow` and tokens without its
`scopes`, errors come back as Problem Details (no hand-built error JSON), and
`openapi emit --check` passes if the project has an OpenAPI file.

## Who gets in

`allow` defaults to `['user']`. Use `['user', 'anon']` for public endpoints
and `['service']` for machine callers. Rejected callers get a 401 with a
`WWW-Authenticate` header, or a 403, as Problem Details.

`scopes` limits what a delegated token may do: a token from the Supabase
OAuth server (`client_id` and `scope`) or one exchanged for an agent (an
RFC 8693 `act` chain). The guard options of `bs.route`, `bs.action`,
`bs.handler` (edge) and `bs.middleware` (Hono, oRPC) take it, next to
`allow`:

```ts
export const GET = bs.route(
  (request, { db }) => db.customers.findMany({ limit: 20 }),
  { scopes: ["customers:read"] },
);
```

With `.claims(schema)` on the definition, `auth.claims` is typed in every
adapter (`c.var.auth`, `context.auth`, the edge handler's `auth`, MCP's
`ctx.auth`). Read roles from it; don't parse the claims again.

A token without the scope gets a 403 with an `insufficient_scope`
challenge. The user's own session holds no `client_id` or `act`, so `scopes`
never limits it. RLS still decides the rows: the token's `sub` is the user.

Never use `@supabase/server/adapters/*` (deprecated, removed 2026-12-01).

Don't build error JSON by hand; errors become Problem Details.

## REST resources

`defineResource` / `bs.resource(table, { operations, list, input })` gives you
list, get, create, update and delete, with validation and paging (`{ items, page }`).
`createOpenApi(betterSupabase, { resources })` describes the same routes, and
`better-supabase openapi emit --check` keeps `openapi.json` in sync.

Pass `pagination: "cursor"` to a resource, `defineListQuery` or an MCP table
for lists that clients read page by page: the list takes `after` instead of
`page`, returns `nextCursor` and `hasMore`, and `size` stays capped by
`maxPageSize`. The OpenAPI document and the JSON Schema describe the cursor.

## MCP servers

- Tools run as the calling user, so RLS applies to every call.
- `authorize(ctx, tool, args)` refuses a call (`{ allowed: false, reason, scopes }`; with `scopes` it is a 403 `insufficient_scope`). `visible(ctx, tool)` hides tools from `tools/list`. Put a permission or a label in a tool's `meta`; clients never see it.
- `scopes` on `createMcp` only advertises scopes. Refuse calls in `authorize`, reading `toSession(ctx.auth).delegation?.scopes`.
- Set `allowedOrigins` and `allowedHosts` (every host the server answers on, previews and local included) against DNS rebinding, and `resourceDocumentation` to a page that explains how to connect.
- On the official MCP SDK, keep its `McpServer`: `createMcpAuth(betterSupabase, { resource })` from `better-supabase/mcp/sdk` verifies the token and serves the metadata (`auth.serve(createMcpHandler(factory))`), and `withBetterSupabaseMcp(server, auth)` gives every `registerTool` callback `db`, `auth` and `bs`. With a permission library that wraps `McpServer`, wrap with it first, then `withBetterSupabaseMcp`.

## Native and offline apps

For Expo and React Native, follow [references/expo.md](references/expo.md):
server loaders for the web, `better-supabase/client/native` on the device.
To read and write offline, run the same repositories on a PowerSync database
and upload through `bs.db`, as in [references/powersync.md](references/powersync.md).

## Background work (`better-supabase/blocks/jobs`, needs `sql add jobs idempotency webhook-inbox`)

- `createJobs(postgres.admin, { queue_name: zodSchema })` runs on Supabase Queues (pgmq): `enqueue(queue, payload, { context: db.$context })` in the request, then `work` or `drain` in a worker, where `const db = await bs.forContext(job.context).orThrow()` runs the work as the enqueuing user with RLS (it fails with `forbidden` for a job without a user; use `bs.admin(job.context)` only for work no user owns). The handler throws to retry. `schedule(name, cron, queue, payload, { timeZone })` uses pg_cron, or with `sql.modules.jobs.options.scheduler: "drain"` a `jobs.drainRoute({ secret: process.env.CRON_SECRET, handlers })` route that Vercel Cron calls; `sql.modules.jobs.options.backend: "table"` runs without pgmq. Queue names are lowercase letters, digits and underscores. With a service-role Supabase client instead of SQL, it uses the `pgmq_public` RPCs (no dedupe or schedules).
- `createIdempotency(postgres.admin).handle(request, handler)` for POST endpoints that clients retry.
- `createWebhookInbox(postgres.admin, { source, secrets }).receive(request)` for webhooks; `process(handler)` later. `createInbox` is its deprecated alias.
- Times are `Temporal.Instant`: `EnqueueOptions.runAt`, `Job.enqueuedAt`, `Job.visibleUntil`, `WebhookInboxMessage.receivedAt` and webhook timestamps.
- Schedule cleanup with pg_cron at a quiet hour: `better_supabase.purge_job_archive('<queue>')`, `purge_webhooks()`, `purge_audit_log()`, `purge_idempotency_keys()`, `purge_rate_limits()`, `purge_outbox()`, `purge_notifications()` and `purge_webhook_deliveries()`, for the modules you installed. Only `service_role` can execute them.
- Audit a table with `better_supabase.audit('public.t', redact => '{secret}', event_prefix => 't')`; record non-row events with `better_supabase.audit_event(event_type, ...)` and an `idempotency_key`. For per-tenant retention, write an `audit_retention(tenant)` SQL function or call `purgeAuditLog(sql, { retention })` from `better-supabase/blocks/audit`, which also has `auditListQuery` and `exportAuditLog` (NDJSON or OCSF). `sql sync` writes a pgTAP file per audited table, and doctor BS315 lists tables without the trigger; exempt the rest with `sql.modules.audit.options.exempt` globs.
- For a "view as user" support mode, add the `support-sessions` SQL module, pass `support: supportSessions({ store: sqlSupportStore(postgres) })` to `createServer`, call `bs.startSupport({ targetUserId, reason })` and `bs.stopSupport()` from server actions, and show a banner with `useSupportSession()`. Sessions are read-only by default; grant admins the `support.start` platform permission.
- For teams, add the `organizations` and `invitations` SQL modules and call them through `createOrganizations({ transport: sqlTransport(postgres.asUser(claims)), events: betterSupabase.events, onInvite })` from `better-supabase/blocks/organizations`. Send the invitation email in `onInvite`, show `previewInvitation(token)` on the accept page, and switch with `organizations.switch(id)`, refreshing the session when it returns `refresh: true`. Errors carry codes such as `ORGANIZATION_SLUG_TAKEN` in `hint`. Existing tables work with `mode: 'adopt'`.
- For user profiles, add the `profiles` SQL module: sign-up creates the row from auth metadata with a unique username and mirrors the email; users update only the `updatable` columns. Adopt an existing table with `mode: 'adopt'` and `syncTrigger: false` when your own trigger creates profiles. Use `avatarBucket()` and `organizationLogoBucket()` from `better-supabase/storage` for uploads; `policy: { access: { read, write } }` checks any bucket through the access contract.
- For events other systems must see, add the `outbox` SQL module and write events with `emit_event(type, payload, subject, tenant, key)` inside the same transaction as the change (the SQL modules emit theirs automatically). Relay them with `createOutbox(postgres.admin, { source }).relayRoute({ secret, consumers: { name: httpSink(url) } })` from `better-supabase/blocks/outbox` after `outbox.register(name, { types })`. Delivery is at least once; receivers deduplicate on the CloudEvent `id`.
- For in-app notifications, add the `notifications` SQL module and send with `createNotifications({ transport: sqlTransport(postgres.asUser(claims)), types })` from `better-supabase/blocks/notifications`, where `types` maps each notification type to a Standard Schema for its data. Pass a `key` so retries don't notify twice. Show them with `useNotifications({ topic, load })` from `better-supabase/blocks/notifications/react`; the topic defaults to `notifications:{userId}`. For email or push, pass `channels` and call `notifications.deliver()` from a cron route with a service connection.
- For webhooks to customers' endpoints, add the `webhooks-out` SQL module and publish with `createWebhooks({ transport: sqlTransport(postgres.admin) }).publish({ type, data, tenant, id })` from `better-supabase/blocks/webhooks`. Pass an `id` so retries don't send twice. Send with `webhooks.deliverRoute({ secret: process.env.CRON_SECRET })` from a cron route; deliveries are signed with Standard Webhooks and only go to public HTTPS URLs by default.
- Each SaaS block below is an SQL module of the same name plus `better-supabase/blocks/<name>`, called through `sqlTransport(postgres.asUser(claims))` for user actions and `postgres.admin` for service work; errors carry a code in `hint`. Its docs page is `https://bettersupabase.com/docs/blocks/<name>.md`.
  - `api-keys`: `createApiKeys`, and `auth: { resolvers: [apiKeyResolver({ keys })] }` in the adapter so key callers get `auth.kind === "apiKey"`. Show a new key once; only its hash is stored.
  - `settings`: `defineSettings` with a Standard Schema per key; `usage`: `createUsage` with a `key` per increment, `within_quota` in policies; `billing`: `createBilling` with `stripe` as an optional peer; `flags`: `createFlagsProvider` for OpenFeature, `flag_enabled(key)` in policies.
  - `comments`, `attachments` (signed URLs, served only after a scan), `data-lifecycle` (exports, organization deletion with a grace period), `sso` (verified domains, SAML, SCIM), `onboarding` (`defineChecklist`, `useOnboarding`), `waitlist` (`createWaitlist`, `waitlistHook` for invite-only sign-up) and `announcements` (`createAnnouncements`, `useAnnouncements`).
  - `workflows`: `createWorkflows` for the run registry of any engine (`runs.list`, `runs.requestCancel`), schedules and admission whose `tick` hands each start to an engine, and `useWorkflowRuns` from `better-supabase/blocks/workflows/react`. With the Workflow SDK, add the `workflow-sdk-world` module, set `WORKFLOW_TARGET_WORLD=better-supabase/workflow-sdk/world`, start runs with `startFor(ctx, workflow, args)` from `better-supabase/workflow-sdk` so members see them under RLS, pass `workflowStarter({ name: workflow })` to `tick`, and check `authorizeHook(token, ctx)` before `resumeHook`. The World is Node-only (`https://bettersupabase.com/docs/blocks/workflow-sdk.md`).
  - `workflow-builder`: `createBuilder` with `compile: compileGraph` and `start: graphStarter({ steps, executor })` from `better-supabase/workflow-sdk/builder`, and a service-role `service` transport for webhooks, events, `credentials.resolve` and `nodeRuns.record`. Call `steps.sync()` at deploy time so publishing accepts the steps. Wrap each step in `nodeRunReporter` for the canvas status, and read it with `useWorkflowCanvasRun` (`https://bettersupabase.com/docs/blocks/workflow-builder.md`).

Done when a failing job is retried and then archived after `maxAttempts`,
a replayed webhook or POST doesn't run twice, and each block table has a purge
schedule.

## Direct Postgres on the server

- `createPostgres()` opens a pool; `createPostgres({ pool })` runs on an existing `pg.Pool`. `asUser` and `anon` transactions get Supabase's role timeouts (8 s and 3 s); `statementTimeout` takes a number or `{ admin, authenticated, anon }`.
- `createMany` and `upsertMany` split inserts past 65,535 bind parameters into several statements in one transaction, so large batches don't need manual chunking.
- In serverless functions, connect through the transaction pooler (port 6543), not a direct connection.

## Testing

Sign tokens with `signLocalJwt` or `asUser` from `better-supabase/testing`;
the adapter verifies them against the local JWKS. See the `better-supabase-testing` skill.
