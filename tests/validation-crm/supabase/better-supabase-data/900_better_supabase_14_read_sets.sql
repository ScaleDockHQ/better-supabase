-- better-supabase block: read-sets (0.5.1)
-- @bs-block-data read-sets
-- Rows and settings a schema diff doesn't capture. Run `better-supabase sql data`
-- after the schema migration to put them in a migration.
-- Managed by `better-supabase sql add`; re-running it overwrites this file.
-- Change it through `blocks` in better-supabase.config.ts and the module's SQL hooks.
